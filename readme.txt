Name: Gustavo Gonzalez
Time: 23 hours 
Problems: None
Notes: Spent a majority of the time on the flood fill algorithm and debugging the reset and winning conditions.
As you can see in my code there is a lot of console logs to help debug, I chose to leave those in there.

In URL you can adjust rows and columns, like this example: `http://localhost/index.php?rows=10&columns=10&probability=0.2`

Resetting will keep the board the same, refreshing the page will change the locations of bombs when started.
